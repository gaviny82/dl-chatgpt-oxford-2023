That means that the off-the-shelf model is going to have the wrong output shape.\n",

        "- There may be a generic image classifier online, but it's unlikely there is a model for classifying different types of bicycles in New York City\n",
        "- There may be a generic sentiment classifier online, but it's unlikely that there is one for detecting specific variations of positive sentiments in recently evolved colloquial language (slang, abbreviations, acronyms) used by a particular segment of TikTok users in comments.\n",
        "- There may be a generic text summarisation model online, but it's unlikely that there is one for summarising a specific type of medical literature on the conditions relating to human memory\n",
